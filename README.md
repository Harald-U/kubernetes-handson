# Kubernetes Hands-on

Based on [Docker 101](https://harald-u.github.io/docker-101/) which in turn is based on the [Docker Getting Started Tutorial](https://github.com/docker/getting-started). The Docker tutorial uses a Node.js based ToDo app. This app is packaged as a Container image and then run on Docker, first stand-alone using a built-in database, and then as a multi-container app with docker-compose, running MySQL as database in a second container.

This workshop is published with Github Pages here:
